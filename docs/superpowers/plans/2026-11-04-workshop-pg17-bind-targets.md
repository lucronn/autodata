# Workshop PG17 Bind-Target Structural Audit Successor Plan

**Goal:** Permit only proven Docker-created empty acquisition bind-target directories in the stopped overlay diff, retain every other audit and cleanup constraint, and keep all quarantined APKs unusable.

Issue: https://github.com/lucronn/autodata/issues/186
Project: https://github.com/users/lucronn/projects/8; item `PVTI_lAHOCSJ8cc4BiQ2BzhFocs4`.
Base: `e1ca20812dd4f037eda9d439b69cf0cb96d895dd`; adopted failed gate `7f0201cc2b26cc8fbcd0637386f5cf047320c970`.
Immutable harness `54ab7dce19c36ce7ea3403259dd1ecc66bf323aa`; implementation allowlist empty.

## Scope and actual red evidence

Planning only: no Docker invocation, container create/start/export, download/retry, install, image mutation, harness, integration or production action. Independent exact-checkpoint review and fresh coordinator dispatch are required before Task1A. This supersedes only the acquisition overlay guard's blanket rejection of added mountpoint directories, and permits two bounded read-only structural filesystem exports as described below. All other acquisition-overlay, inspected-preparation and APK-log constraints remain mandatory. Offline simulation/install/image review and original Task2 remain separately authorized and unchanged.

Retained raw directory `/home/corp/autodata-evidence/pg17-overlay-prep-20261104-01/evidence`: task1a-blocker.json SHA256 `36ea1490633250d79fddf2f5c1f7b92abe19f043e8ab4544dc1519f3afd9ee52`; stopped-diff.txt `f644241d7c563ce99a81d3cf0ba36af3582bc221b19054fc1f509fea8cad221d`; stopped-audit.json `17c03aab7df37281f535e5e2f32d0d28c7afc88191a169087a3ec8589f2d7754`; before-start.json `0d655fcb331127f737bf9c7223e6fcb88dc139acbe60f39ae1f2ec99a86d2470`; quarantined manifest `bc44b2eb0cede2db890e8b09ffbdf673bb3ef0e98c1ffd94a9c9e0a9c7ef8c55`.

Exact removed container `102eb97013e3b69e567b0179b59dc14416a167748bbd81200d5c9fabb30d1f17` exited0, no OOM/error/overflow, stdout8898/stderr0 bytes, verified signatures for33 APKs, and all27 baseline records unchanged. Full stopped diff was exactly `A /apks` and `A /control`; the approved guard rejected both. Removal/absence and unchanged normalized volume inventory were proved. This remains a failed attempt: all33 APKs are quarantined, unaccepted and forbidden for reuse, including after this successor is reviewed. No downstream phase occurred.

Read-only inspection of retained `base-image.tar` (SHA256 `60ae29e1f3496f1ec842b48995fcc631d9c6e918b20da48a154fd7258fa3106d`) found zero `/apks`, `/control` or descendant entries in any of its10 layers. Config digest matches exact base `sha256:ab20e934b27ba3ff927c1b4c9ff8cf6c32f315f743efe68dd3441182a87fb085`. This diagnoses added bind-target directories; it does not retroactively prove their underlying type/emptiness in the deleted container. The historical red rows therefore still fail the new context guard without new structural proof. Pure fixtures are synthetic and confer no retry authority.

## Fresh attempt: before-start identity and mount proof

Use the preceding acquisition overlay plan's exact create argv, private realpaths, image pins, fixed signed APK payload, four bounded tmpfs, two binds, bridge network, uid0:0, sole DAC_OVERRIDE cap, no-new-privileges, resources, deadlines, output caps and no-source/no-secret rules unchanged. In particular private PGDATA tmpfs overrides inherited VOLUME; no writable host root or additional mount is authorized. Keep all27 base hash/type/owner/mode records and full original configuration validation.

Before start, capture exact full ID, gate label, image, State.Status=created, RestartCount=0, full inspect and volume inventory. Require `/apks` bind exactly the new private `$PREP/apks`, RW=true; `/control` bind exactly new private `$PREP/control`, RW=false. No duplicate/overlapping mount destinations, anonymous volume or other bind. Inspect's source realpaths must equal the previously validated private host directories; mounts must be type bind, not volume/tmpfs. Host directory contents are not evidence that underlying mountpoint directories are empty. Record baseline target absence from the exact saved base's authenticated ordered layers (including whiteout handling); missing archive, wrong config/layer digest or ambiguous tar member fails.

Before the first created-state export/diff, complete all inherited prestart `docker cp` baseline snapshots and the unchanged27-record saved-base comparison; those existing copies materialize the bind-target directories. Only after every copy succeeds, run the bounded structural export below on that exact still-created ID, and retain full prestart `docker diff` requiring exactly `A /apks` and `A /control`. No payload runs until this audit and all prior prestart guards pass. A different base directory arrangement requires a new plan; do not generalize to arbitrary mountpoints.

## Bounded read-only underlying filesystem audit

A filesystem `docker export ID` excludes mounted volume/bind contents and exposes underlying root directories. Read-only source review of [Moby v28.5.2 daemon/export.go](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v28.5.2/daemon/export.go) (Git blob `ba3d98a7facb133b9359480ec03cbc6730c24f60`, source SHA256 `2f224f5a822350baa52203423f9249a4bbb03ab7fca31d0657747d285203de99`) shows `containerExport` mounts only `ctr.RWLayer`, then calls `chrootarchive.Tar(basefs, ..., basefs)`; it does not assemble container bind/volume mounts. The entry point rejects dead/removing containers but does not require a previous start. This supports created and stopped underlying-root audits on the retained Docker28.5.2+dfsg4/overlay2 engine; future operator must confirm unchanged engine/storage driver and preserve this source evidence. Any mismatch or inability to establish these semantics blocks before start. Source inspection is not an actual exporter execution. It does not execute the container or create an image. Its sole permitted purpose here is structural inspection of the exact two root-layer directories, once while created and once after stopped. This is a narrow exception to the predecessor's inspect/diff/cp-only audit restriction. Never import/commit/load/reuse/export this overlay as an image, pass its archive to an installer or use it as harness source. No Docker execution occurs while drafting this plan.

Future approved operator uses argv `['docker','export',EXACT_CAPTURED_ID]` without a shell, after ownership/state checks. Stream stdout in <=65536-byte chunks into a new exclusive mode0600 archive in private mode0700 `$PREP/evidence`; each export has a60s deadline and512MiB total stdout cap, stderr1MiB cap, with byte counts, SHA256, return code and supervision result retained. No Docker `--output` bypass of the host byte cap. Reaching/exceeding a cap, timeout, nonzero exit, short/truncated archive or parse error fails; terminate the export client and retain bounded failure receipt, then exact-owned cleanup under existing bounds. No restart/exec or unbounded retry. These caps are audit limits, not a claim of hard overlay disk quota.

Read each completed archive using host Python tarfile, never extract it. Limit to50000 logical entries and512MiB declared cumulative regular-file sizes. Validate tar completion/headers; reject duplicate normalized paths and ambiguous target names. Normalize only one optional leading `./` and a directory's trailing slash; reject absolute names, NUL, traversal, repeated separators or other aliases. For `/apks` and `/control`, require exactly one directory tar entry each (type5), uid=gid=0, mode0755, size0, empty linkname and no PAX path/linkpath or sparse override. Reject files, symlinks, hardlinks, devices/FIFO, omitted targets and any member with either target plus `/` prefix. These checks prove empty underlying directories; ignore mounted APK/control contents and timestamps only. Other root members are not executed/extracted and do not receive any new diff allowance.

Retain both export hashes/byte counts and normalized target metadata. Created and stopped target metadata must match exactly; both must pass emptiness/type checks. Re-inspect same image/ID/gate before and after export; require created/never-started for first, stopped exit0/OOMfalse/emptyerror for second, no concurrent writer/restart or changed mounts. The stopped diff and all original27 baseline audits remain mandatory. Unexpected output or inability to prove volume-exclusion semantics is a blocker, never an excuse to inspect the bind-visible directory instead. After receipts/hashes are retained, delete only these exact owned audit archive files (no import/reuse); archive deletion failure blocks acceptance.

## Context-bound stopped diff rule

Preserve all prior row/action/normalization/count/duplicate and baseline/type/hash/lock/4096-byte checks. New exception: only `A /apks` and `A /control`, each backed by saved-base absence, the exact prestart bind proof, matching valid empty created/stopped directory records and successful bounded audit receipts. This is an allowance for directory metadata only, not file content. Both directory rows must remain present, consistent with their absent base and created overlay state. `C`/`D` for these paths, any child or other added directory fails. Do not filter the full diff or catch validation failure as success.

The fixed pure row/context predicate is below; trusted context is produced only by all audit/identity/bounds checks above, not caller-supplied booleans alone. Original baseline/type/size checks remain separate and mandatory.

```python
TARGETS = {'/apks': True, '/control': False}
LOCK_PATH = '/lib/apk/db/lock'
DIRECTORIES = {'/lib', '/lib/apk', '/lib/apk/db', '/var', '/var/cache', '/var/log'}
BASELINE_FILES = {'/lib/apk/db/installed', '/lib/apk/db/triggers',
                  '/lib/apk/db/scripts.tar', '/etc/apk/world'}
EXPECTED_DIRECTORY = {'type': '5', 'uid': 0, 'gid': 0, 'mode': 0o755,
                      'size': 0, 'linkname': '', 'children': []}
def validate_acquisition_diff(rows, proof):
    assert type(proof) is dict and set(proof) == set(TARGETS)
    for path, rw in TARGETS.items():
        p = proof[path]
        assert p['base_absent'] is True and p['audit_bounds_passed'] is True
        assert p['bind_type'] == 'bind' and p['bind_rw'] is rw
        assert p['exact_private_source_verified'] is True
        assert p['created'] == p['stopped'] == EXPECTED_DIRECTORY
    assert type(rows) is list and len(rows) <= 128
    seen = set()
    for row in rows:
        assert type(row) is str and len(row) <= 256 and '\n' not in row and '\x00' not in row
        assert len(row) >= 4 and row[1] == ' ' and row[0] in ('A', 'C')
        action, path = row[0], row[2:]
        assert path.startswith('/') and '//' not in path
        assert all(part not in ('', '.', '..') for part in path.split('/')[1:])
        assert path not in seen
        seen.add(path)
        assert ((action == 'A' and path in TARGETS) or path == LOCK_PATH or
                (action == 'C' and path in DIRECTORIES | BASELINE_FILES))
    assert set(TARGETS) <= seen
```

## Cleanup, output boundary and concrete todo

All original zero-exit/signature/package/unchanged-baseline/complete-diff audits and exact-owned stop/kill/rm --volumes/absence/normalized-volume inventory checks apply. Acquisition is never restarted, committed or reused. New archive proof does not accept old quarantined APKs. Only a newly dispatched fresh attempt that passes every audit and cleanup may freeze its independently verified APK closure for separately authorized offline phases. Every runtime/harness/production/schema/grant/service/deployment readiness assertion remains false. No implementation changes or Task2 expansion.

- [ ] Synchronize exact red receipt, bounded structural audit and context-bound diff guard in Issue186/Project8/canonical docs; push exact gate and pinned preflight for independent review.
- [ ] After independent exact-gate review/adoption and fresh coordinator Task1A dispatch only, create a fresh acquisition container and collect full prestart bind inventory plus bounded underlying filesystem structural audit before start.
- [ ] Require exact empty directory metadata before/after, absent saved-base targets, unchanged 27 baseline records and original complete stopped diff/signature/exit audits; reject files, descendants, aliases, deletions and missing proof.
- [ ] Retain prior 33 quarantined APKs as failed evidence, never accept/reuse them; any future fresh output requires all audits and exact-owned removal/absence/volume proof.
- [ ] Keep acquisition commands/network/caps/mounts and offline simulation/install/image/Task2 authorities unchanged; no planning Docker/download/retry/harness action or readiness claim.

## Reviewed bind-target gate adoption and mandatory operation ordering

Adopted source gate `016ea37722f36fa0c8b2b509884e75bef6ac41b2`, receipt `c7d57a3347621c5559d5a671997142da1a1f43dc`; exact reviewed plan SHA256 `40e0591c8742a37983cf289d565c9df7d4e263c7caa5cc4e8e7f38b3b36f49ed`. Coordinator relayed independent approval of this exact plan. Adoption branch `codex/workshop-pg17-bind-target-adoption`; dedicated record `docs/agents/records/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-bind-target-adoption.json`, task `docs/agents/tasks/2026-11-03-production-release/workshop-pg17-bind-target-adoption.json`. This adoption performs no Docker operation or retry and conveys no production/harness readiness.

**Mandatory future order (resolves the created-state mountpoint feasibility condition):** (1) create exact-owned fresh acquisition container under the unchanged approved argv, validate full created inspect/config/bind inventory and pinned base archive; (2) complete **all inherited prestart `docker cp` baseline snapshots** and the unchanged27-record saved-base comparison while still created/never-started; these existing copy operations materialize the bind-target directories; (3) only **after those copies finish successfully**, perform the first bounded created-state underlying filesystem export and full prestart diff, requiring the exact empty root-owned `/apks` and `/control` directories plus `A /apks` and `A /control`; (4) only after every inherited and new prestart guard passes may the coordinator-dispatched payload start; (5) after stopped exit0, perform the bounded stopped export/full diff/unchanged-baseline audits, then exact-owned cleanup and output acceptance boundary. Never run the first export/diff before the inherited copies or start merely to materialize targets. Failed copies, missing/changed/nonempty targets or any ambiguity fail closed and clean the exact owned attempt. No extra container command, mount or authority is added.

All prior export bounds/source semantics checks, acquisition payload/image/network/caps/resources/mounts, signature verification, quarantine, baseline/row/type/empty checks and cleanup remain mandatory. This ordering clarification does not accept or reuse the historical33 quarantined APKs. Offline simulation/install/image review and original Task2 remain separately authorized and unchanged. No deployment, integration, production grant/runtime action or readiness follows.

Concrete adoption todo:

- [ ] Record independent approval of exact gate016ea377 and reviewed plan SHA256, synchronize adoption Issue186/Project8/canonical docs, then push and pin passing full-SHA preflight.
- [ ] Only after new coordinator dispatch, validate exact created acquisition ID/config/bind inventory; complete every inherited prestart docker cp baseline snapshot and unchanged27-record comparison BEFORE first created-state export/diff.
- [ ] Then require bounded created-state underlying empty-directory export and exact A /apks,A /control diff; only after all guards pass may the fixed acquisition payload start.
- [ ] Require matching stopped structural export, complete original baseline/diff/signature/exit audits and exact-owned cleanup/absence/volume proof before accepting any newly acquired APK closure.
- [ ] Never accept/reuse historical33 quarantined APKs; no Docker/download/install/harness on adoption turn; offline stages/Task2 and all production/readiness denials unchanged.

## PG17 complete mount-record ordering successor: plan only

Correct only order-sensitive acquisition Mounts inspection comparison using complete records keyed by unique exact Destination, retaining all raw/canonical hashes, red receipts and unchanged acquisition guards.

Plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-mount-order.md`; record `docs/agents/records/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-mount-order.json`; task `docs/agents/tasks/2026-11-03-production-release/workshop-pg17-mount-order.json`. Base da1f42a; actual fresh acquisition attempt stopped before startup on inspect Mounts array order only,0 APKs, exact-owned cleanup/absence and unchanged volume inventory. Preserve red result/diagnosis exact hashes in dedicated evidence. Replace only top-level Mounts array order-sensitive equality with complete-record canonical JSON by unique exact Destination; duplicates/missing/extra paths or any field drift reject. All original config/structural/baseline/signature/diff/payload/cleanup and offline/Task2 limits unchanged. Live tracking synchronized; independent exact-checkpoint review/root dispatch remain pending. No retry authority. No planning Docker/retry/download/harness.

Concrete todo:

- [ ] Synchronize the narrow mount-order plan, exact red receipts and complete-record fixtures with Issue186/Project8/canonical docs only after coordinator releases tracking slot; commit/push and pin passing full-SHA preflight for independent review.
- [ ] Require independent exact-checkpoint review/adoption and fresh coordinator Task1A dispatch before any new Docker operation; use a new private run and never restart/reuse prior failed containers or APKs.
- [ ] Retain raw before/after inspect bytes and SHA256; canonicalize only top-level Mounts array record order by unique exact Destination, require exactly /apks and /control and preserve every complete record field/value.
- [ ] Require original complete config/mount predicates plus canonical equality at every acquisition Mounts comparison; duplicate/missing/extra destinations, field/type/value drift, invalid JSON or ambiguous input fail closed.
- [ ] Keep all predecessor created-copy/export/diff ordering, structural/exit/signature/baseline/resource/network/payload/cleanup bounds and offline/Task2 separation unchanged; no planning Docker/retry/download/harness or readiness claim.

## Reviewed complete mount-record ordering adoption: plan only

Adopt independently approved source gate `cdbedc871104484d931113ce74c84be0b8ba449e`, receipt `1e43e64a9b1b8237bbc9656aa311d0c7d13d5698`; exact reviewed plan SHA256 `8eb158a7101959b23a096487366692b6f8990c73e6ad4b79c303eb4cae5a302b`. Source review evidence `/tmp/autodata-pg17-mount-order-cdbedc87-review.json` retained as `docs/agents/records/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-mount-order-adoption-review.json` with original hash. Adoption branch `codex/workshop-pg17-mount-order-adoption`; dedicated record `docs/agents/records/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-mount-order-adoption.json`, task `docs/agents/tasks/2026-11-03-production-release/workshop-pg17-mount-order-adoption.json`. Live tracking synchronized after coordinator slot release. Root must verify the full adopted-SHA preflight and issue fresh Task1A dispatch before any runtime action.

The sole correction is top-level Mounts array comparison by complete records keyed/sorted by unique exact Destination. Retain every record field and raw before/after inspect hashes plus canonical hash; missing/extra/duplicate destinations, field additions/removals/type/value drift or malformed/duplicate-key JSON fail closed. All original config predicates and HostConfig equality remain. No extra Docker command, mount, capability, source, network or retry authority. All inherited created-copy27-baseline-before-export/diff ordering, exact empty underlying-target proof, bounded exports, full stopped diff/context/baseline/signature/exit audits and exact-owned removal/absence/volume inventory remain mandatory.

The prior created-state attempt remains failed with0 APKs; result SHA256 `6db4e39f3b01adb90b42985b44a6949b6670774fc8fc9e0f84ab7be96c4f5c4d`, diagnosis SHA256 `5654ed1637e63f2facb6ee2b52a8589fb685e7996bac0e44498b130db2376695`. Missing structural metadata is not inferred retroactively. Historical33APKs remain quarantined and never reusable. Root must verify full adopted-SHA preflight and separately dispatch any new Task1A. No adoption Docker/create/start/export/retry/download/install/image commit/PG startup/harness action; offline stages/Task2 and production/provider/cloud/runtime authority unchanged. All readiness remains false.

Concrete adoption todo:

- [ ] After coordinator tracking-slot release, synchronize exact independent approval/plan hash and unchanged Task1A scope in Issue186/Project8/canonical docs, preserve CURRENT prior Project index verbatim/hash, commit/push and pin full-SHA preflight.
- [ ] Only after root verifies adopted pinned preflight and dispatches fresh Task1A, use a new exact-owned private run; compare complete Mounts records by unique exact Destination, retaining raw before/after/canonical hashes and rejecting any missing/extra/duplicate destination or field drift.

## PG17 acquisition diagnostics and structured volume receipts: plan only

Correct only acquisition diagnostic false positives and volume inventory serialization by anchored status checks and bounded structured complete-volume inspection, retaining all existing guards and failed-output quarantine.

Plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-acquisition-receipts.md`; record `docs/agents/records/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-acquisition-receipts.json`; task `docs/agents/tasks/2026-11-03-production-release/workshop-pg17-acquisition-receipts.json`. Retained second-attempt result/diagnosis hashes and full offline replay in `docs/agents/records/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-acquisition-receipts-evidence.json`. Attempt exited0 and passed structural/context/baseline guards, then failed host substring/Labels CSV order checks; all33 fresh APKs quarantined NEVER reusable, prior33 also never reusable. Correct only anchored status/empty-stderr diagnostics and bounded read-only complete structured volume inspect metadata by unique Name; every field/value retained, only JSON key order ignored. Explicit new metadata-read authority requires reviewed/adopted gate/root dispatch. All other Task1A/Task2 constraints unchanged; no planning Docker/retry/download/harness.

Concrete todo:

- [ ] Replay the revised fixed pure predicates against complete retained second-attempt evidence and all existing positive/negative fixtures; synchronize goal/plan/todo/red evidence/structured inventory authority with Issue186/Project8/canonical docs after coordinator slot release; commit/push and pin full-SHA preflight.
- [ ] Require independent exact-gate review/adoption and root verification/fresh Task1A dispatch before any Docker/retry; use a new private exact-owned run, never historical quarantined APKs or failed containers.
- [ ] Use unchanged bounded fixed acquisition payload and source/signature/index/hash checks; classify only empty stderr plus successful supervised attach/stopped status and reject anchored diagnostic forms, preserving full raw output and hashes.
- [ ] Before create and after exact-owned removal, capture bounded volume ls names and one bounded read-only structured volume inspect per exact name; compare complete objects by unique Name preserving every field/value and ignoring JSON object key order only.
- [ ] Keep mandatory27 prestart copies BEFORE first created export/diff, complete Mounts canonical guard, empty underlying target audits, full stopped diff/context/baseline/exit checks and owned cleanup unchanged; no offline/install/image/PG/harness/production readiness follows.

## PG17 diagnostic Unicode Cc review correction: plan only

Correct only the blocked acquisition diagnostic character filter to reject Unicode Cc controls except LF/tab; preserve all existing receipt guards, quarantine and runtime denials.

Corrected plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-control-filter.md`; record `docs/agents/records/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-control-filter.json`; task `docs/agents/tasks/2026-11-03-production-release/workshop-pg17-control-filter.json`; evidence `docs/agents/records/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-control-filter-evidence.json`. Prior4bc40e26 remains independently BLOCKED for DEL/C1 acceptance. Only diagnostic unicodedata import/Cc predicate changed, LF/tab sole control exceptions; complete83-case offline replay plus65 Cc probes pass (148total/0fail). All structured-volume and predecessor constraints unchanged; both33APK sets quarantined NEVER reusable. Independent exact-corrected-checkpoint re-review/adoption/root dispatch required; no planning Docker/retry/download/harness.

Concrete todo:

- [ ] Preserve exact blocked gate/plan hash and reproduced DEL/C1 negatives; update only diagnostic Cc filter/import, rerun complete83-case pure/replay suite plus65 Cc probes, then synchronize Issue186/Project8/canonical docs after coordinator tracking-slot release.
- [ ] Commit/push docs-only corrected checkpoint, pin passing full-SHA preflight and exact tracking readback while preserving CURRENT Python SIGTERM and PG predecessor index verbatim/hash.
- [ ] Require independent exact-corrected-checkpoint re-review/adoption, root verification and fresh Task1A dispatch before any Docker/retry/download/harness; previous blocked gate grants no adoption authority.
- [ ] Keep structured complete volume metadata collection/comparison and every original source/payload/config/mount/copy/export/diff/baseline/signature/cleanup bound unchanged; both33APK sets remain quarantined NEVER reusable.
- [ ] Retain all red receipts as failed and offline replay as predicate evidence only; no retrospective acceptance, offline install/image commit/PG startup/harness/production action or readiness claim.

## Reviewed Cc-safe acquisition receipt adoption

Adopt independently approved corrected gate `b96a68e59a370314a207e67b98d67a9949584432`, receipt `eee037dd1857cec1d0817b1b3421c7280c9284f6`; exact reviewed control-filter plan SHA256 `ad2a433f532e1b7b8000588d126d9789392f6e593a5c460681b900bff403420e`. Approval was relayed directly by coordinator after independent re-review. Historical predecessor4bc40e26 remains a blocked superseded checkpoint; this adoption consumes only the corrected approved chain. Adoption branch `codex/workshop-pg17-receipts-adoption`; record `docs/agents/records/2026-11-04-workshop-pg17-receipts-adoption.json`, task `docs/agents/tasks/2026-11-03-production-release/workshop-pg17-receipts-adoption.json`.

The fixed classifier requires empty stderr and zero successful supervised/stopped status, rejects anchored diagnostic forms, and rejects every UnicodeCc character except LF/tab. All original source-output/index/key/signature/package/hash checks remain mandatory. Structured volume metadata uses bounded read-only ls names plus one complete inspect object per exactName: <=32names,60s total inventory,10s each inspect,512KiBstdout/64KiBstderr each,16MiB totalstdout/2MiBstderr. Exact same Name set; compare COMPLETE objects including all fields/values and null/map distinctions, ignore only JSON object key order; duplicate/missing/extra names/fields or any drift fail. Raw/hash/canonical receipts are mandatory. No CSV Labels substitution or four-field projection.

Full predecessor chain retained: exact cached image/payload/repositories; no source/secret bind; private inherited PGDATA override plus original tmpfs/binds; original network/caps/security/resources/output/deadline bounds; complete config and uniqueDestination Mounts records; ALL27 inherited prestart cp snapshots+unchanged comparison BEFORE first created export/diff; bounded created/stopped underlying empty target proof; complete stopped diff/context/baseline/signature/exit audits; exact-owned stop/rm--volumes/absence/structured inventory proof. No acquisition commit/restart/reuse; no arbitrary retry/guard change. Offline simulation/install/image review and original Task2 remain separately authorized and unchanged.

Both historical33APK sets (overlay first and bound-target second payload attempts) remain quarantined, unaccepted and NEVER reusable. Red result/diagnosis and missing prior structured proof are not rewritten. Pure148-case/replay success is predicate evidence only. Root must independently verify full adopted-SHA preflight and issue a FRESH Task1A dispatch before any new Docker operation. This docs-only adoption performs no Docker/create/start/export/retry/download/install/image/PG/harness/implementation or production action; no readiness follows.

Concrete adoption todo:

- [ ] Synchronize exact corrected independent approval/plan hash and full Task1A guard chain in Issue186/Project8/canonical docs while preserving CURRENT prior Project index/detail verbatim/hash; commit/push and pin full-SHA passing preflight.
- [ ] Require root independent adopted-gate verification and FRESH Task1A dispatch before any Docker/retry; use a new private exact-owned run and never historical failed containers/APKs.
- [ ] Use the fixed anchored diagnostic/status classifier rejecting all UnicodeCc except LF/tab, empty stderr and successful supervised/stopped status; retain complete raw outputs/hashes and all original source/index/signature/hash checks.
- [ ] Collect complete structured volume inspect objects for exact boundedls names before create/after owned removal:32names/60s inventory/10s perinspect/512KiBstdout64KiBstderr perinspect/16MiB totalstdout2MiBstderr; compare complete objects by uniqueName, all fields/values preserved and only JSON key order ignored.
- [ ] Keep all inherited image/payload/network/caps/resources/private mount guards,27 prestart copies BEFORE first export/diff, complete Mounts comparison, bounded empty underlying target exports, full stopped diff/context/baseline/exit and owned cleanup/absence checks; both33APK sets remain quarantined NEVER reusable.
- [ ] No adoption Docker/retry/download/install/image commit/PG startup/harness/implementation/integration/production/provider/cloud action; offline stages/Task2 separate and all readiness remains unverified.

JS deadline slot released; frozen-input acceptance index synchronized. No Docker/install/harness.

Concrete todo:

- [ ] After JS deadline coordinator releases Issue186/Project8 slot, synchronize exact reviewed closure/result/manifest/hash acceptance in Issue186/Project8 and canonical docs, preserving CURRENT full index/detail verbatim/hash; commit/push and pin docs-only full-SHA preflight.
- [ ] Keep raw Task1A receipts and accepted-apk-manifest bytes immutable; use this adjacent acceptance index to record independent review without rewriting the original pending-review manifest status or either failed/quarantined attempt.
- [ ] Accept only exact33APK filenames/versions/architectures/hashes in the pinned manifest as future input; verify all host hashes again before any later authorized consumer and reject mutation or substitution.
- [ ] Require a NEW decision-complete synchronized Task1B gate, independent review, root verification and fresh dispatch before offline simulation/install/image commit or toolchain inspection; no execution authority follows from closure acceptance.

- [ ] Obtain independent review of this exact simulation-only checkpoint; require coordinator adoption/root verification and fresh one-attempt dispatch before any Docker command.
- [ ] On authorized fresh simulation only, reverify all33 immutable APK hashes/signatures, use exact20 literal apk-add paths, inspect complete offline resources/mounts and mandatory prestart27 copies before created export/diff.
- [ ] Require deterministic bounded parser with exactly20 additions and no baseline actions, complete unchanged27/package45/world/keys/PG/scripts/trigger/lock state and created/stopped empty bind-target proof; fail closed/quarantine/no retry.
- [ ] After exact-owned removal/absence/complete-volume equality, independently review simulation receipts; a NEW installation gate must pin same20 APK argv and audit BusyBox-trigger effects. No installation/image commit/PG/harness/readiness is authorized now.
